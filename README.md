# THIS BOT IS PERSONAL, IT MAY BE BROKEN
this is just a personal project of mine to mess around with discord.py and understand how some of the coding aspects of bots work

if you have any feature ideas, or requests be sure to let me know :3

## The issues tab is partially me logging things I know need to be fixed or worked on, but if you use it personally you can add errors and feature suggestions too!
