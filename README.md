# LOGS ARE BROKEN RIGHT NOW, WILL FIX LATER. <br>also admin commands sometimes look for the role "Staff" so if they dont work that's most likely why
<br>Remember to put your bot token in the .env file if you are going to use this yourself.
this is just a personal project of mine to mess around with discord.py and understand how some of the coding aspects of bots work

if you have any feature ideas, or requests be sure to let me know :3

# Current Features:

- Daily command that resets at 0:00 in the bots local time
- Kick Command
- Timeout Command
- Interaction commands (Crashout, Celebrate, GFY (Go Fuck Yourself), Keep Yourself Safe, Lose, Beg, Rate, Gaydar) 
- Logs for my personal server.
- There are also a bunch of random commands scribbled about like the cogtest, or rarity testing commands that are leftover from previous things I've decided to scrap. 

# Known Issues:
- Channels for logs are not easily configurable. This may be fixed in the future. 
- Currently as of writing, the bot startup time message does not work. This could be due to rate limiting. 
- Log formats are not very pretty, will fix them with nicer embeds in the future as it previously had some decent embeds. But due to wanting to rewrite the bot they haven't been implemented yet.

# Notice: 
I may be very infrequent with updates to this, so if there is an issue with the bot it may be better to reach out to me personally: menininebu on discord 
<br> <br>PLEASE STATE THAT YOU NEED HELP WITH IT. OTHERWISE I WILL PROBABLY IGNORE YOUR DMS
